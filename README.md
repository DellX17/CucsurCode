# CucsurCode
Yet another college project. This is a database manager that is supposed to help teachers to easily share information with their students and help the latter to share their thoughts on the content.

It's also kind of a CMS, but very limited.

Using this project as a base I created the Web Application that the company SIFO uses today as a complement to their desktop app, "Sifo punto de venta".
